Sure, here is the MySQL script to create a database and a schema, and then create a table to store the COVID-19 data with the parameters you provided:

SQL
CREATE DATABASE covid_data;

CREATE SCHEMA covid_data;

USE covid_data;

CREATE TABLE covid_cases (
  iso_code VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  continent VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  total_cases INT NOT NULL,
  new_cases INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (iso_code, date)
);

This script will create a database called covid_data, a schema called covid_data, and a table called covid_cases with the following columns:

iso_code: A varchar column for the country's ISO code.
continent: A varchar column for the country's continent.
location: A varchar column for the country's name.
date: A date column for the date of the data.
total_cases: An integer column for the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country on the given date.
new_cases: An integer column for the number of new COVID-19 cases in the country on the given date.
The PRIMARY KEY constraint on the iso_code and date columns ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identified by the country's ISO code and the date of the data.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
