Main SQL Notes. 


0 - Structured Query Language (SQL) –a database language used to create databases and tables, alter/design structure, and move data into, out of, and within a database


0 - Constraints – additional information in a command that allows for specific actions on a database object.  NULL, NOT NULL,  UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, AND DEFAULT are used when initializing a value for a new record within a table.



0 - IMPORT/EXPORT -  for adding or extracting data from an existing table in a database.



0 -MySQL Workbench – a GUI based tool we will use to work with MySQL databases.

Basic Structure of SQL Queries - Select
by Madison WattsMadison Watts
Lesson 5 of 9
SQL data manipulation language

The SQL data manipulation language (DML) is used to query and modify database data

SQL DML command statements

SELECT – to query data in the database
INSERT – to insert data into a table
UPDATE – to update data in a table
DELETE – to delete data from a table
SQL DML Statement syntax notes (in MySQL)

A SQL DML statement is composed of a sequence of clauses in free format. For example, both are fine:

select   *

from     city

where   CountryCode = "USA"

and

select * from city where CountryCode = "USA"


bullet
SQL language is case insensitive. For example, select is the same as SELECT, and CountryCode is the same as counterycode.


bullet
In-line comments begin with --


bullet
Strings can be quoted in single or double quote, for example,   both “USA“ and 'USA’ are valid strings.

Basic Structure of SQL Queries
 select/from/where/group by/order by

A simple example of SQL queries using these three clauses select, from, and where is:
-- This in an in-line comment:  note SQL language is case-insentive

select name, population      -- get city name and population

from city                               -- name the table(s) queried

where population > 100000 -- apply the filter condition

Formally, the syntax of basic SQL queries is as follows (the order of clauses must be as given):

*Note only SELECT is required (i.e., the others are optional)

SELECT [Distinct] item(s)

FROM table(s)

WHERE predicate

GROUP BY field(s)

ORDER BY fields

 INSERT UPDATE and DELETE  in tables.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modification of Database - insert/update/delete
by Madison WattsMadison Watts
Lesson 8 of 9

bullet
Insert - Use various forms of the Insert statement to insert data into a table.
 


bullet
Update - Use Update statement and its options to update data in database tables.


bullet
Delete - Use the Delete statement to delete rows from one or more tables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT STATEMENT

UPDATE STATEMENT

DELETE STATEMENT
------------------------------------
The Insert statement allows you to insert one or more rows into a table.
 The following illustrates the syntax of the Insert statement:


Insert Into table(c1,c2,...)
Values (v1,v2,...);



First, Specify the table name and a list of comma-separated columns
 inside parentheses after the Insert Into clause.



Then, put a comma-separated list of values of the corresponding 
columns inside the parentheses following the Values keyword.



Example:
Insert a new row into the city table

Insert Into city(id, name, countrycode, district, population)
Values (4080, “Sky”, “AFG”, “Kabol”, 0);



Not all columns in the table city are required in the list.
 If a column is not in the list,
 the default value of the column will be inserted.


========================================================================
 UPDATE - 

The Update statement updates data in a table. It allows you to
 change the values in one or more columns of a single row or 
 multiple rows. The following illustrates the basic syntax of 
 the UPDATE statement:

UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] table_name

  SET 

  column_name1 = expr1,
   column_name2 = expr2,

  ...
  [WHERE condition]
 
Specify the table name after the Update keyword.

Specify which column you want to update and the new value in the SET clause.

Specify which rows to be updated using a condition in the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause is optional. If you omit it, the UPDATE statement will modify all rows in the table.


Example:

In the city table, update the population of the row of id equal to 4089:

UPDATE city

SET population = 100

WHERE id = 4080

------------------------------------------



- DELETE statement - 

The DELETE statement allows you to delete rows from a table.
 The following illustrates the syntax of the DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;



First, specify the table from which you delete rows.



Second, use a condition to specify which 
rows to delete in the WHERE clause. The DELETE statement
 will delete rows that match the condition.

Notice that the WHERE clause is optional. If you omit the 
WHERE clause, the DELETE statement will delete all rows in the table.


Example: From the city table, delete the rows which have zero population:


delete city

where population = 0
