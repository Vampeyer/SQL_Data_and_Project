for the final prjoject  , I am asked to simply , but importantly create a database 
from a CSV file , or , a comma sepereted value file. 

With this as my requirements , 

- - - 
Your assignment is design and implement a database
 to store covid19_subset.csv data in 
 your chosen database management system (DBMS), for example, MySQL. 
 Specifically, you will follow these steps to do the project: 
 1. Design a database schema based on the requirements.  
 2. Create a SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) script to define the database schema.  
 3. Apply the script in step 2 to create a database in the chosen DBMS  
 4. Import covid19_subset.csv to the database created in step 3. 
 5. Run a couple of SQL queries to test your database implementation.    
 
 
 
 
 ------------------------------
 
 This was accomplished by downloading MySQL community installer , 
 which contains several small important pieces of tools. One mainly being MySQL 
 workbench as a DBMS. 
 
 to start , download the community installer , then inside download MySQL workbench and server. 
 Open MySQL and click on the plus to create a server connection , follow the steps then open the box
 that was created to start a connection to the server. 
 
***-Install everything as a full service , and install it as a microsoft service to avoid errors. 
Install MySQL workbench and MySQL server especially 
 
 
 After opening the server - make sure you are connected to it.
 This can be done by seeing the text that notifies you if you are not connected 
 OR 
 by going to the start stop server tab , and making sure the server is connected and started. 
 
 
 
 - After this , the scripts were ran , 

 - one to first create the database 
 -then to create a schema for the database. 
 - then to use or select the schema as the default. 
 - then to create a table named    covid_cases 
   with the appropriate columns and types , within  
   () braces .
 
 =================
 
 this was the script I used ,  
 
 
 
 -CREATE DATABASE covid_data;

-CREATE SCHEMA covid_data;

-USE covid_data;

-CREATE TABLE covid_cases (
  iso_code VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
  continent VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  total_cases INT NOT NULL,
  new_cases INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (iso_code, date)
)


each dash should be ran indicidually.   



-------------- 



then , -  AFTer you can click on the  " schemas ' tab , 
and you should be able to see the default 
database , with the respective schema and table inside 

*** - may require a server restart



*** Modify the date format to be correct fo reloading into MySQL Database  
 - YYYY-DD-MM
